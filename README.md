# bitcoin-regime-prediction
Machine learning project for detecting Bitcoin market regimes and predicting short-term price movements.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses historical Bitcoin data to detect **market regimes** (bullish, bearish, sideways) and predict short-term price movement probabilities. By combining **time-series analysis**, **feature engineering**, and **machine learning models**, the goal is to provide insights that may help understand Bitcoin’s highly volatile behavior.  

## ⚙️ Features  
- Fetches and processes Bitcoin historical price data  
- Applies feature engineering (returns, volatility, moving averages, sentiment signals)  
- Uses ML models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTMs) to detect price regimes  
- Predicts short-term upward/downward movement probabilities  
- Visualizes market states and predictions with easy-to-read plots  

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost** (ML + data processing)  
- **matplotlib, seaborn** (visualization)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (experiments & demos)
